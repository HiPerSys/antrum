# Sets up a TAP interface for a VM to use to bridge a wireless interface. The 
# interface is created and assigned an IP address in the same network as the 
# VM's Ip address. IP forwarding is enabled, and proxy ARP is enabled for the 
# TAP and wifi interfaces. A route for the VM's IP address is created for the 
# TAP device. Needs to run
#  (1) before the VM is created and 
#  (2) before Nimbus restarts the local dhcp server.
# Meant to be paired with cleanup-vm-network.
# Arguments:
#  $1 - The name of the TAP device
#  $2 - The IP address of the VM
#
# NOTE: Passwordless sudo required for script to run properly!
