# ABOUT #
#########

# This script is called via sudo to adjust dhcp policies.
# Use sudo version greater or equal to 1.6.8p2
# See: http://www.gratisoft.us/sudo/alerts/bash_functions.html

# This script must be owned and writable only by root and placed in a non-
# tamperable directory.

# SYNTAX:

# See the "adjust as necessary" section below.

IFS=' '

\unalias -a

set -f -e -u -C -p -P

# set:
#
# -f
#     Disable file name generation (globbing).
# -e
#     Exit immediately if a simple command (see section Simple Commands)
#     exits with a non-zero status, unless the command that fails is part
#     of an until or while loop, part of an if statement, part of a && or
#     || list, or if the command's return status is being inverted using !
# -u
#     Treat unset variables as an error when performing parameter expansion.
#     An error message will be written to the standard error, and a
#     non-interactive shell will exit.
# -C
#     Prevent output redirection using `>', `>&', and `<>' from overwriting
#     existing files.
# -p
#     Turn on privileged mode. In this mode, the $BASH_ENV and $ENV files are
#     not processed, shell functions are not inherited from the environment,
#     and the SHELLOPTS variable, if it appears in the environment, is ignored.
#     If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to
#     the real user (group) id, and the -p option is not supplied, these
#     actions are taken and the effective user id is set to the real user id.
#     If the -p option is supplied at startup, the effective user id is not
#     reset. Turning this option off causes the effective user and group ids
#     to be set to the real user and group ids.
# -P
#     If set, do not follow symbolic links when performing commands such as cd
#     which change the current directory. The physical directory is used
#     instead. By default, Bash follows the logical chain of directories
#     when performing commands which change the current directory.

# NOTE that the -e flag is why we do some odd || checks below

# NOTE: these things are configured here, sorry.  They can not be arguments
#       sent into a program run under sudo.  Consider what could happen if the
#       priviliged account could send in any argument for the conf file to
#       adjust or any argument for the command to run 'start' and 'stop' with.
#       In the event that someone compromises the privileged account, allowing
#       arbitrary arguments for those things could allow the attacker to abuse
#       the sudo privilege to do other, unexpected things.
