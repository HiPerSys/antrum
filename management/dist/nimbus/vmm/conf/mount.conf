# mounttool is a script with elevated privileges to mount and alter VM images
#
# It is called under sudo.  A relevant entry for it must be configured in the
# sudoers file, see the "sudo.conf" file.
#
# Because it is called under sudo, the program, these conf files, and all
# enclosing directories should be owned by root.
#
# If this setting is a relative path, it will be resolved from the
# workspace-control specific libexec directory (see "dirs.conf")
#
# If this setting is empty or missing, mount+edit functionality will be disabled

mounttool: mount-alter.sh


# mountdir is where images are mounted.
# If this setting is a relative path, it will be resolved from the
# workspace-control specific var directory (see "dirs.conf")

mountdir: mnt


# tmpdir is where custom files (originally sent from the nimbus remote user) 
# are stored before moving them to the VM
# If this setting is a relative path, it will be resolved from the
# workspace-control specific var directory (see "dirs.conf")
#
# *** The tmpdir path must be known to the central Nimbus service

tmpdir: tmp


# fdisk is used when an HD image is in use instead of a partition file.  fdisk
# will be used to determine the offset of the 1st partition inside the HD image
# 
# If this setting is empty or missing, mount+edit functionality will be disabled
# for HD images.
#
# If this setting is a relative path, it will be resolved from the PATH

fdisk: /sbin/fdisk

# qcow2 is a virtual machine image format with many features, notably delayed
# allocation.  qcow2 images can dynamically grow while the virtual machine is
# being executed.  As such, Nimbus IaaS administrators should be careful and
# monitor disk usage when enabling qcow2 support.
#
# If this setting is set to true, qcow2 support will be enabled.

qcow2: true
