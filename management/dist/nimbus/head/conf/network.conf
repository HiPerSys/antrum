# NOTE: The addresses to give out to VMs are configured in the "network-pools"

#       (public, private, etc) and its contents contain the addresses in that
#       pool.

# Prefix for unique MAC address assignments.
#
# Quoting admin guide: "In summary, an address of the following form should
# be OK: XY:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX where X is any hexadecimal digit, and Y is one
# of 2, 6, A or E"
#
# Setting a too-long prefix will limit the amount of IPs you can support.
#
# MAC addresses can also be explictly assigned in the network-pool files.
# Explicit MACs do not need to start with this prefix.

# Network to choose netsample IP and MAC from. This is only generally used
# when you are first installing Nimbus and attempting to get correct network
# bridging working on your VMM. Specifying an invalid or empty network here
# will result in the netsample file not being written.
