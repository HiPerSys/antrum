# If listen is true, a server will listen for requests and grant information to
# clients whose IPs can be correlated with a running VM (modelled on EC2's
# implementation).
#
# This implies that entities on your network cannot spoof addresses (VMs run
# under Nimbus will not be able to because of the ebtables rules in place).
#
# This implies that the VMs themselves can ping an interface on this machine.
#
# To be safe, you should probably add an iptables rule that blocks traffic
# from the WAN to this server's port.

listen=true


# The metadata server can listen on multiple interfaces. However each VM must
# be provided a contact address it can route to directly, *without* going
# through a NAT. This is because authorization is done by source IP.

# In situations where there is no common interface that all networks can route
# to, you must provide specific contact addresses for each VM network. This
# means your service node must have an interface for each contact address.

# Understand that these settings control two things: (1) which interfaces/ports
# the metadata server binds to, and (2) what contact address is injected into
# each VM.


# If you specify *only* this setting, all VMs will be given this address.
# If you also include specific network contact sockets below, this address
# will be given to VMs that do not have a presence on one of the explicit
# networks. This value can be 0.0.0.0 as long as you have entries for each
# VM network below. You can also comment this line out
contact.socket=@HOST@:8080


# These are per-network contact addresses. If a VM has a presence on more than
# one of these networks, the first network in the request will be used. If a VM
# has a presence on none of these networks, the default contact.socket above
# will be used if present.

#contact.socket.public=1.2.3.4:8080
#contact.socket.private=10.0.3.4:8080


# List of network names for "public-ipv4" queries.  i.e., which pool did the
# public NIC come from?
#
# - If there is a NIC in the VM with one of these network names, the metadata
#   server will respond to a "public-ipv4" query with the IP address and the
#   "public-hostname" query with the matching hostname.
#
# - If there is not a NIC in the VM with one of these network names, the
#   responses to those queries will be blank.
#
# - If there are multiple NICs in the VM with one or more of these network
#   names then the match from the first one in the list is chosen (the list's
#   order is maintained).

public.networks=public


# List of network names for "local-ipv4" and "local-hostname" queries.  Same
# rules as above.

local.networks=private, privatenogw


# Customization path
# If this setting is non-empty AND listen=true, the workspace service will
# add an additional customization task which will place a file on the VM (at
# this path) that contains the URL to use for the metadata server.

customization.path=/var/nimbus-metadata-server-url
