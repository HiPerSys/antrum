# The process of workspace-control triggering the "pull" of files from
# somewhere to the VMM node is also known as "propagation"
#
# The process of workspace-control triggering the "push" of files from
# the VMM node to somewhere for saving is also known as "unpropagation" and
# "making transport-ready"  ("transport-ready" means the files are ready
# to be moved off-site, the term assumes the repository is a bridge/edge node
# between the site and "the world" but this doesn't technically need to be
# the case).
#
# In either case, workspace-control intiates the transfer commands, so see its
# "worksp.conf" file to look at changing default options etc.

# You can disable file transfers entirely by setting this to "false"
#
# Disabling it can be a sane option.  For example, if your setup includes
# one of various methods to access cluster storage via local unix paths (but
# beware NFS, using NFS for images that are not read-only comes highly
# unrecommended).  Or if you are using one VMM only and always getting images
# directly from localhost.
